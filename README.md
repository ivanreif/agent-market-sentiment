## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Configure environment variables (create a `.env` or `.env.local` file)

```bash
# Get your API key from https://key.bitte.ai
BITTE_API_KEY='your-api-key'

ACCOUNT_ID='your-account.near'
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will:
- Start your Next.js application
- Launch make-agent
- Prompt you to sign a message in Bitte wallet to create an API key
- Launch your agent in the Bitte playground
- Allow you to freely edit and develop your code in the playground environment

5. Build the project locally:

```bash
pnpm run build:dev
```

This will build the project and not trigger `make-agent deploy`

- using just `build` will trigger make-agent deploy and not work unless you provide your deployed plugin url using the `-u` flag.
